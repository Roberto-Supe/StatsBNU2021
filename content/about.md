This site was built to provide additional information and content to the course **Environmental Statistics** at Beijing Normal University. The graphs, analysis, and statistical methods included in the posts have the code to be replicated with your data. All the information in the articles followed the lecture slides of the lecturer and course coordinator [Professor Yingxia Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yingxia-Li), figures and models were translated to R code by Ph.D. student [Roberto Xavier Supe Tulcan](https://xaviersupe.netlify.app/) (Supervisor: [Professor Ouyang Wei](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Ouyang-6)).

It is a page created for you to be familiar with R, one of the biggest and my favorite statistical program. I used some of the essential packages that will help you during your studies and career. Learning some coding and more complex software will open many doors in multiple fields; it will expand your abilities, skills, knowledge, and of course, your resume.
